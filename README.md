# 🔋 EV Price Predictor

A **Machine Learning + Streamlit** web app that predicts the **price of Electric Vehicles (EVs)** based on their technical specifications such as battery capacity, efficiency, top speed, acceleration, and range.

## 🚗 Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to estimate the price of electric vehicles by analyzing important performance and design features. The model is trained on real-world EV specifications and deployed as an interactive web app using **Streamlit**.
